## Proof

Recorded local flow uses running AegisFlow MCP and admin endpoints against mock GitHub upstream:

1. Repository list is allowed.
2. Repository deletion is blocked.
3. Pull request creation waits for review.
4. Reviewer approves exact action.
5. Retry reaches upstream.
6. Signed evidence chain verifies.

## Try it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saivedant169/AegisFlow.git
cd AegisFlow/starter-kit
./install-pr-writer.sh
```

Go 1.26.6 or later, Node.js, `curl`, and `jq` are required.

## Boundary

AegisFlow governs traffic routed through configured endpoint. It does not sandbox agent process and cannot stop direct calls that bypass gateway. Built-in editor file and shell actions need explicit routing through MCP or another supported boundary.

Please post policy examples, setup problems, or boundary questions in Discussions. For security reports, follow [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/saivedant169/AegisFlow/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
