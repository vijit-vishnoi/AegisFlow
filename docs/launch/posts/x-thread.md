Coding agents call tools with real side effects. AegisFlow puts allow, review, or block policy on configured MCP and model paths before upstream execution.

v0.9.0 proof uses running local gateway, not staged UI.

Recorded flow:

`github.list_repos` -> allow
`github.delete_repo` -> block
`github.create_pull_request` -> review
approve exact action -> retry allowed
signed evidence -> valid

## 3

Approval is single-use. Request ID and timestamp can change on retry. Repository, branch, title, actor, task, and arguments must match or policy asks for new review.

v0.9.0 adds supported tool-call translation, per-session signed evidence, scoped credential requests, checksum verification, Sigstore bundle, SBOM, and build provenance.

Boundary: AegisFlow governs traffic routed through it. It does not sandbox agent process or catch calls that bypass gateway.
