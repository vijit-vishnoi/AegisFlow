# Changelog

All notable changes to AegisFlow will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project loosely follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) while it is pre-1.0.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-18

This release tightens tool boundaries, scopes evidence and credentials to each session, and adds verifiable release artifacts. It also carries tool calls across supported provider adapters instead of dropping them during translation.

### Added

- Tool-call types and translation for OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, Gemini, and Ollama paths.
- Optional `messages_api.tool_passthrough` support for the inbound Messages API. It remains disabled by default until each deployment verifies its provider tool loop.
- Policy checks for tool definitions, tool arguments, and MCP `tools/list` responses.
- Resumable review handling in the MCP gateway.
- HMAC signatures on evidence records and one evidence chain per session.
- Scoped GitHub App installation tokens and AWS STS session policies.
- `docs-writer` policy pack with tuning notes.
- Prebuilt installer with checksum verification.
- End-to-end HTTP load test and a config sized for repeatable local measurements.
- CodeQL, OpenSSF Scorecard, SBOM generation, keyless release signatures, and build provenance.
- GitHub Container Registry publication alongside Docker Hub.

### Changed

- OpenAI-compatible and Messages API requests now share input, output, streaming, cache, spend, and kill-switch lifecycle checks.
- Streaming output is scanned incrementally before bytes are sent to clients.
- Approvals apply to one exact action and are consumed once.
- Tool-policy target matching uses doublestar semantics, so `**` crosses path separators.
- Evidence storage uses independent session chains with idle-session cleanup.
- Shared provider clients use one tuned HTTP transport.
- In-memory rate-limit windows, behavioral history, usage writes, analytics histograms, and semantic-cache work are bounded or batched.
- Go toolchain requirement is 1.26.6.

### Fixed

- Approval resume now matches stable action fields, so an identical retry can consume an approved review even when request IDs and timestamps differ.
- Provider adapters no longer drop system prompts or supported tool definitions and tool calls.
- Anthropic streaming and non-streaming requests now run the same policy checks as OpenAI-compatible requests.
- Stream scans no longer happen after untrusted output reaches a client.
- Evidence hashes use length-prefixed fields instead of an ambiguous delimiter join.
- Evidence, usage, policy, and MCP session paths no longer share unsafe global state.
- MCP policy reloads now reach the watched gateway engine.
- MCP SSE sessions and rate-limit windows are cleaned up after expiry.
- GitHub and AWS credentials now carry task-specific scope.
- Approval records cannot authorize a different action or be reused.
- Federation config responses redact provider credentials, broker tokens, Redis passwords, database connection strings, signing keys, webhook secrets, and approval integration tokens.
- Sensitive upstream errors and secret-bearing values receive stricter handling.
- Governance load tests disable response caching when measuring provider latency, so repeated requests exercise full policy, upstream, and evidence paths.

### Security

- Tool-policy target globs now use doublestar matching, so `**` patterns (e.g. `**/.ssh/*`, `**/credentials*`, `docs/**`) match nested paths. The previous `path.Match` did not support `**` and never crossed `/`, which silently disabled nested-path secret-block rules and could let a nested secret (e.g. a read of a deep `.ssh` key) fall through to an allow rule. Path-based blocking is still best-effort; see T2 in the threat model. (#111)

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-03

Runtime-governance identity, an Anthropic-native gateway path, and operator DX. This release lets Claude Code and the Anthropic SDK route through AegisFlow so their prompts are governed and audited before they reach a provider, surfaces policy decisions in Prometheus, adds a data-explorer policy pack, and sharpens the CLI and docs.

### Added

- **Inbound Anthropic Messages API** (`POST /v1/messages`): route Claude Code (via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) and the Anthropic SDK through the gateway. Prompts run through the same input/output policy + audit pipeline as the OpenAI path, with streaming re-framed as Anthropic SSE events and tool-use requests rejected loudly rather than silently degraded. (#102)
- `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` so Anthropic clients can budget context (estimate).
- Request transforms and model aliasing now apply on the `/v1/messages` path, matching the OpenAI handler.
- **Prometheus `aegisflow_policy_decisions_total{decision,protocol}`** counter, incremented in the MCP gateway and exposed on `/metrics`. (#79)
- **`sql-explorer` policy pack** for BI/data agents: `SELECT` allowed, `INSERT`/`UPDATE` reviewed, `DELETE`/`DROP`/`TRUNCATE`/`GRANT`/`REVOKE` blocked. Includes tuning notes and a contract test. (#87)
- `aegisctl status --json`, `aegisctl pending --json`, and `aegisctl test-action --dry-run` for automation and safe policy iteration. (#86, #77, #83)
- `--version` / `-v` flags on the `aegisflow` binary. (#96)
- Config startup warnings for tool-policy rules referencing an unknown protocol. (#78)
- nginx + Caddy reverse-proxy guide, a troubleshooting guide, and a CLI automation example. (#84)
- GitHub Discussions and structured issue forms for community reports.

### Changed

- README repositioned to lead with runtime governance for coding agents; legacy gateway content moved under a supporting section.

### Fixed

- MCP stdio bridge now returns a JSON-RPC error when the gateway is unreachable instead of echoing an empty line that left clients hung on "connecting".
- Upstream provider errors are redacted to a generic message for clients (detail logged server-side) on the chat, stream, and WebSocket paths. (#103)
- Streaming policy-scan buffers are bounded to a sliding window so memory and scan cost stay linear on long streams. (#103)
- `golang.org/x/net` updated to v0.55.0 for GO-2026-5026.

### Security

- Audit-log `detail` is built with `json.Marshal` instead of string concatenation, preventing malformed or forgeable audit JSON when a prompt or policy message contains quotes; prompt truncation is now UTF-8 rune-safe.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-22

This release focuses on production readiness: safer deployment defaults, stronger validation, release hygiene, and automated checks that make the runtime easier to operate with confidence.

### Added

- Docker Compose smoke test covering gateway health, admin health, a successful chat completion, and a policy-blocked request.
- CI smoke job that runs the local production-style Docker Compose check.
- CI vulnerability scan using `govulncheck`.
- `make smoke` and `make vuln` targets for local production checks.
- Production readiness checklist for operators.
- Support for loading tenant API keys from environment-backed secrets with `key_env`.
- Helm values and templates for secret-backed tenant API keys.
- More admin and CLI coverage around invalid JSON, policy rollback, and startup config loading.

### Changed

- Go toolchain requirement updated to 1.26.2.
- Docker builder image updated to `golang:1.26.2-alpine`.
- Docker image now starts the built `aegisflow` binary directly.
- Helm deployment now uses configured service ports and sets `AEGISFLOW_CONFIG`.
- Release metadata aligned across CLI, dashboard, MCP gateway, OpenAPI, and Helm charts.

### Fixed

- Startup config validation now catches duplicate, empty, and conflicting tenant API key entries.
- Docker build context now excludes local development and generated files through `.dockerignore`.
- Go formatting is now enforced in CI.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-12

This release wires up previously disconnected subsystems, hardens error handling and test coverage, and adds policy versioning — the ability to track, diff, and rollback policy changes at runtime.

### Added — Runtime integration

- **Approval notifications**: Slack and GitHub notifiers now fire automatically on submit, approve, and deny. Previously the notifier code existed but was never called (`_ = approvalNotifiers`).
- **Behavioral kill switch**: The session anomaly detection engine (6 rules: exfiltration, privilege escalation, credential abuse, destructive sequences, fan-out, repeated escalation) is now wired into the gateway. Sessions that exceed the configurable risk threshold are auto-blocked with HTTP 403.
- **Manifest drift enforcement**: Drift detection now supports a configurable `enforcement_mode` (`warn` or `enforce`). In enforce mode, drift violations block actions. Default is `warn` for backward compatibility.
- **Evidence reports**: New `RenderMarkdownReport()` and `RenderHTMLReport()` produce human-readable session reports for auditors. Available via admin API (`/admin/v1/evidence/sessions/{id}/report` and `/report.html`) and CLI (`aegisctl evidence report`).
- **Policy versioning**: In-memory version history (last 20 snapshots) with automatic snapshots on config reload. New admin API endpoints (`/admin/v1/policy-versions`, `/current`, `/{version}`, `/{version}/rollback`). New CLI commands (`aegisctl policy history`, `policy current`, `policy rollback <version>`). Rollback atomically replaces engine rules.
- **Enhanced `aegisctl status`**: Now shows providers, pending approvals, evidence sessions, budgets, and recent violations — not just UP/DOWN.
- **Evidence admin adapter**: SessionChain now exposed to admin API with export, verify, and report endpoints.

### Fixed — Error handling and consistency

- **aegisctl JSON decode errors**: 18 call sites across 7 files silently ignored malformed JSON responses. All now properly report errors via `decodeJSON` helper.
- **Unified error response format**: Admin API (48 sites), identity admin, and httpgate all migrated from `{"error":"msg"}` to structured `{"error":{"code":N,"type":"...","message":"..."}}` matching the gateway format.
- **MCP gateway upstream errors**: Error messages now include tool name, upstream name, and remediation hint instead of raw `connection refused` (#82).
- **Config startup validation**: 11 new rules catch empty provider names/types, duplicate providers, routes referencing unknown providers, tenants with no API keys, duplicate tenant IDs, negative rate limits, and negative max body size at startup instead of runtime.

### Improved — Test coverage

- Overall project coverage: 56% to 63%+
- `internal/identity`: 48% to 92% (29 admin handler tests + ConnectorAdmin SoD rule)
- `internal/approval`: 54% to 80% (IsApprovedForTool, CleanupExpired, notifier tests)
- `internal/admin`: 23% to 65% (77 tests covering all endpoint categories)
- `internal/capability`: 74% to 92% (admin adapter tests)
- `internal/usage`: 64% to 100% (tracker + cost estimation tests)
- `internal/evidence`: 60% to 68% (export + report tests)
- `internal/config`: 12 new validation tests

### Changed

- `internal/toolpolicy/Engine` is now thread-safe with `sync.RWMutex` and supports `ReplaceRules()` for live policy updates
- README updated with 37 admin API endpoints (was 17), 37 internal packages (was 23), and documentation for all new features

### Contributors

- API key rotation support (rk-python5, PR #75)
- CI badge fix (tanmaykadam1533, PR #88)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-07

This release is the pivot. AegisFlow used to describe itself as an AI gateway. Now it is an open-source runtime governance layer for tool-using agents. The gateway features are still here, but they sit behind the governance plane as supporting infrastructure.

### Added — Agent execution governance (Phase 6)

- ActionEnvelope core type: every agent action gets normalised into one policy-evaluable object with actor, protocol, tool, target, parameters, requested capability, decision, and an evidence hash
- MCP remote gateway (JSON-RPC 2.0 and SSE transport) on port 8082 so Claude Code, Cursor, and other MCP clients can connect directly
- Tool policy engine with glob matching and three first-class decisions: allow, review, block
- Approval queue for human-in-the-loop review, with submit, approve, deny, and history
- Session evidence chain with SHA-256 hash linking and tamper detection
- Fail-closed governance mode (with a break-glass override for dev/debug)
- aegisctl commands: `test-action`, `pending`, `approve`, `deny`, `verify`, `evidence`, `simulate`, `why`, `diff-policy`, `manifest`, `supply-chain`
- Protocol connectors: shell (with dangerous command detection), SQL (with operation classification), GitHub (with risk tiers), HTTP (reverse proxy with host allowlists)
- 10 end-to-end Phase 6 integration tests

### Added — Task-scoped credentials (Phase 7)

- GitHub App credential broker with real RS256 JWT signing (pure stdlib, no external JWT library)
- AWS STS credential broker with SigV4 signing inlined (no AWS SDK dependency)
- HashiCorp Vault broker for database secrets with lease management
- Static credential broker as a clearly-labelled degraded fallback
- Credential registry with periodic cleanup of expired tokens
- Credential provenance recorded in the evidence chain, so every action is linked to the exact short-lived credential used
- Admin API endpoints for listing active credentials and revoking them

### Added — Evidence, policy packs, benchmarks, and demo (Phase 8)

- Evidence export and session manifests with human-readable reports
- `aegisctl verify` for audit chain and session verification
- `aegisctl evidence` for export and session listing
- Three blessed policy packs: `readonly`, `pr-writer`, `infra-review`
- Governance overhead benchmarks: policy evaluate (~1.2 µs), full allow pipeline (~5.2 µs), review path (~1.3 µs)
- Attack demo pack with 20 scenarios across shell, SQL, GitHub, HTTP, and credential theft
- One-click Docker Compose demo and interactive demo script (9 steps)

### Added — Governed Coding Agent Starter Kit (Phase 9)

- Complete `starter-kit/` directory with everything a team needs to adopt AegisFlow in 15 minutes
- PR-writer focused installer (`install-pr-writer.sh`) with prerequisite checks, sanity tests, and a verified install-to-running time under 10 seconds on a dev machine
- Claude Code and Cursor setup guides with copy-paste configs
- Production deployment templates: Docker Compose, Helm chart, Terraform for AWS ECS Fargate
- Efficacy test pack: 20 attack scenarios plus 2 legitimate operations, pass/fail report output
- Sample evidence bundle and human-readable session report

### Added — Adoption sprint (Phase 10, in progress)

- `docs/PR_WRITER.md` proof page: one concrete scenario walkthrough with real output, real hashes, and real decisions
- Tuned `pr-writer` policy pack: `git status`, `git log`, `git diff`, `pytest`, `go test`, and other everyday commands now pass without interruption; dangerous operations still hard-blocked

### Added — Enterprise grade (all 12 uplift items)

Tier 1 (must-build):
- Typed resource model with hierarchical policy matching and environment awareness
- TaskManifest with intent-to-execution drift detection
- Capability tickets: HMAC-signed one-purpose execution tokens with nonce replay protection
- Policy simulation and explainability (`aegisctl simulate`, `why`, `diff-policy`)
- Safe execution sandboxes for shell, SQL, HTTP, and Git with architectural safety constraints

Tier 2 (hardening):
- Behavioral session policy engine with sequence-based threat detection (exfiltration, privilege escalation, destructive sequences, fan-out, credential abuse)
- Approval integrations: GitHub PR comments and Slack webhooks, with approval timeout auto-deny
- Enterprise identity model: org → team → project → environment hierarchy with separation-of-duties rules
- Signed policy and connector supply chain with trust tiers and strict-mode verification

Tier 3 (operational maturity):
- Resilience: component health monitoring, safe degradation modes, retention policies, backup/restore, circuit breakers
- Threat model (10 threat categories), OWASP Agentic Top 10 control mapping, deployment guide, security questionnaire, saved-incident narratives

### Added — Gateway layer (Phase 5)

- Semantic caching via embedding similarity with a configurable cosine threshold
- Cost optimisation engine that suggests cheaper model alternatives based on real usage
- Request/response transformation: PII stripping from responses, per-tenant system prompt injection, model aliasing
- Load shedding with three priority tiers
- WebSocket endpoint at `/v1/ws` for persistent connections
- GraphQL admin API with 13 queries and 5 mutations alongside the existing REST API
- WASM plugin SDK with tutorial and two example plugins
- 16 new integration tests

### Changed

- README rewritten to lead with the PR-writer workflow and governance positioning, not the gateway one
- Default policy engine mode is now fail-closed (break-glass mode exists for explicit opt-in)
- Gateway features are now described as supporting infrastructure behind the governance plane, not the main story
- Architecture diagram redrawn to show agent → AegisFlow (policy, credentials, evidence) → tools
- Roadmap section reorganised to show Phase 6–10 agent governance work alongside the completed Phase 1–5 gateway work

### Fixed

- MCP gateway now checks approval history before blocking, so an approved action can be retried successfully on the second attempt
- Approval queue is correctly wired into the MCP gateway (was previously passing nil)
- `aegisctl approve` now passes the API key on authenticated endpoints
- Audit endpoint in the demo script now uses the admin API key
- Demo API key role bumped from operator to admin for audit verification access
- MCP gateway upstream URL switched from Docker hostname to `localhost:3000` for local dev
- `tool_policies` rules in the realworld config now use `protocol: "mcp"` instead of `"git"` to match actual MCP transport
- Merge conflict resolution for semantic caching and governance branches

### Security

- Fail-closed is the default behaviour for the policy engine
- Capability tickets prevent replay through nonce and HMAC signing
- Evidence chain integrity is provable via `aegisctl verify`
- Credential provenance means every action is attributable to a specific short-lived credential
- Supply chain signing covers policy packs and connectors (not just WASM plugins)
- Shell sandbox redacts environment variables matching credential patterns
